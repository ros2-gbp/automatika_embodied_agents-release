"""
Clients are standard interfaces for components to interact with ML models or vector DBs served by various platforms. Currently ROS Agents provides the following clients, which cover the most popular open source model deployment platforms. Simple clients can be easily implemented for other platforms and the use of heavy duct-tape "AI" frameworks on the robot is discouraged ðŸ˜….

```{note}
Some clients might need additional dependacies, which are provided in the following table. If missing the user will also be prompted for them at runtime.

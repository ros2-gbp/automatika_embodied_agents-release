# EmbodiedAgents Developer Docs

EmbodiedAgents is the intelligence layer of the [EMOS](https://github.com/automatika-robotics/emos) ecosystem. It provides AI component abstractions, model client integrations, and semantic memory for building physical AI agents on ROS 2.

This site contains **developer documentation** for contributors extending the framework with new components, clients, models, or message types.

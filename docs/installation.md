# Installation üõ†Ô∏è

## Pre-Requisits

### Install ROS

_EmbodiedAgents_ is built to be used with ROS2. All ROS distributions starting from _Iron_ are supported. Install ROS2 by following the instructions on the [official site](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Installation.html).

### Install a model serving platform

The core of _EmbodiedAgents_ is agnostic to model serving platforms. It currently supports [Ollama](https://ollama.com), [RoboML](https://github.com/automatika-robotics/robo-ml) and any platform or cloud provider with an OpenAI compatible API (e.g. [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [lmdeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy) etc.). Please install either of these by following the instructions provided by respective projects. Support for new platforms is being continuously added. If you would like to support a particular platform, please open an issue/PR.


```{tip}
For utilizing larger models, it is recommended that model serving platforms are not installed directly on the robot (or the edge device) but on a GPU powered machine on the local network (or one of the cloud providers).
```
